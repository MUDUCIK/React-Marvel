# React Marvel is a hands-on project.

Just for study. Just to test my skills.

### Install all packages by typing `npm i` in console

### To start the application, type `npm start`

## Used libraries:

```
styled-components
react-router-dom
react-helmet

react-scroll
```

## What the app does:

This app interacts with the [Marvel Developer Portal](https://developer.marvel.com/) API to get characters, comics and
information about them.
